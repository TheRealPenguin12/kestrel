# Kestrel

Kestrel is a programming language with a simple syntax, designed for beginners who just started coding text.

## Syntax

### Commenting

Commenting is a way to leave notes to yourself. The `lexer` will ignore comments.

```
% This is a comment!
% This is also a comment!
```

```

### Input

#### Input

```
input: "What's your name? "
```

### Math

#### Addition

Addion is very simple, but important in the math syntax.

```
print: 867485 + 756
```

#### Subtraction

Subtraction.

```
print: 7 - 5
```
#### Multiplication

Ah, multiplication. Of course, we have to have this in our math syntax!

```

```

You can also call multiplication a different way.

```
print: 67(372)
```

#### Division

Division can be easily executed just as simply as the other operations.

```
print:  6 / 2
```
